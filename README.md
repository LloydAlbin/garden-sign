Customizable Garden Plant Label Stake
This is a fork of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4740308

## Summary
Customizable garden plant label sign.

Text string, font, stake size, etc are all customizable using OpenSCAD or Customizer.

Some example STL output files are attached.

(Note that the dots on i's and j's are detached. Consider splitting the STL file in your Slicer and deleting the detached dots.)
